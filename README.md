# SimpleSecureWebsite

This shows a simple site that shows a main page that lets you go to a login screen or go to a list of people screen.  From the login screen you go to what would be the first page after a login on a secured site.  The list of people screen represents the portion of a web site that you wouldn't have to login to get to see.

The site has:
* A start page  (index.html)
* A Login page  (login or LoginServlet)
* A DBManager that gives back a list of User objects
* A People List page that shows the list of people (Users)
* A main page shown after you login (main.jsp)

This site uses:
* Bootstrap to style and show data.  (CSS, HTML and Javascript)
